The results are tested using 2 laptops connected to the Duke wireless network.
The server is also running in the Duke wireless network.
Both TCP and UDP are tested 100 times

UDP RTT (from sending request message to receiving response from server): 0.108 s
Variance: 0.046

The TCP message is always a UTF-8 encoding of an ascii string containing 100 characters.
TCP RTT (from sending request message to receiving ACK of the same message from another peer): 0.235 s
Variance: 0.079

TCP generally takes longer than UDP in terms of RTT. This can be justified by the extra work in TCP
to ensure reliability of transfer, congestion control and flow control.
